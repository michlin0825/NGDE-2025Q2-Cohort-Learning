Week 4
<br>

What I did

- I completed the weekly skill checks by developing a functional snacks voting application and deploying it to AWS using AWS CDK.
- I configured Q Developer integration with my GitHub account based on blog instructions. https://shorturl.at/etJeF

What I learned

- I built a snack voting app (live at https://shorturl.at/OBV6f) using AWS CDK with C#/.NET to provision resources including S3, API Gateway, Lambda Functions, DynamoDB Tables, and Cognito User Pool. In the process, I learned to leverage higher level constructs for cleaner, more concise CDK code. https://shorturl.at/RnxBs

- I built a Python Flask-based Todo App by posting requirements as an issue in GitHub, and having Q Developer integration start coding with its agentic capabilities, until a pull request is finally merged and closed. In the process I learned how AI agents can autonomously handle the development lifecycle. https://shorturl.at/I3MhS

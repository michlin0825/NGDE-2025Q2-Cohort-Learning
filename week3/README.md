Week 3
<br>

What I did


- I cloned a Java-based qwords application from the Q Developer Workshop and generated comprehensive unit tests to achieve maximum code coverage. https://static.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/public/bd52d586-2c33-4585-b8ca-e18c71d89a68/assets/workshop-all.zip
- I performed a security scan of the codebase, identifying vulnerabilities and implementing fixes for all discovered issues. 
- I updated the README to document the test coverage and security improvements for future reference.

What I learned
- I used Amazon Q Developer to truly automate unit test generation, code reviews, and readme documentation. The readme documents extensive test coverage (200+ tests) and risk mitigation measures (e.g., updating Spring Boot version and configuring secure server-side error handling), and is optimized for ease of understanding. https://shorturl.at/127RM
- For consistency, I specifically requested JUnit 5 as the testing framework and the Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA) as testing pattern to improve readability and maintainability.

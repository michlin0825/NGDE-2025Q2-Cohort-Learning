- I learned of using prompt to build a 2048 game. https://shorturl.at/V0ORV

- I also learned about configuring Q Developer customization by uploading versions of Spring PetClinic repositories (Angular, React, and REST API implementations) to S3 buckets to enable customized code suggestions. This approach allows Q Developer to suggest code snippets extending from BaseEntity class for entity implementations and recommend Log4j logging instead of standard Java logging, while maintaining consistency with Spring PetClinic-based microservices architecture. https://spring-petclinic.github.io/docs/forks.html
